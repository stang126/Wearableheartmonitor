Continual and mobile heart rate monitoring is an incredibly powerful source of biometric data that can reveal a myriad of subject-specific health conditions and pathophysiologies. Examples include tachycardia, which may be symptomatic of more serious cardiac events, like stroke or cardiac arrest [1]. A more serious example of a cardiac event that can be detected via heart rate monitoring  is heart failure, where early detection is especially important due to the immediate effects of hypoxia [2]. Additionally, monitoring heart rate during less stressful events, such as exercise, can improve long-term heart health and prevent cardiac damage [3]. However, modern solutions tend to be either too expensive or uncomfortable and immobile, making this technology inaccessible to many and poorly suited to everyday life. Furthermore, the populations that stand to benefit most from continual heart rate monitoring are often underserved and more prone to factors that cause health disease, and lack systemic access to quality healthcare [4]. Rising national poverty rates also contribute to the increasing wealth gap, further highlighting the necessity for accessible medical devices and technologies [5].
