As a proposed solution will have to be a suitable replacement for smartwatches and medical heart rate monitors, solutions must be mobile and comfortable for long time wear as well as be highly accurate. Therefore, a long time wear test to test it comfortability will need to be conducted to understand if it is suitable for long time wear; if users feel uncomfortable wearing the device for long periods of time or develop a skin condition, such as a rash, the device may not be suitable for long term, mobile use.  Additionally, the device must provide an accurate heart beat; such measurements may be directly compared to current commercially available devices or by manually determining our heart rate.
