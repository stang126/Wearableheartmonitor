# Current Solutions

Currently, there are two major categories for existing solutions: smartwatches and medical heart rate monitors. Certain smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, work by conducting EKGs which have users complete the circuit by putting their finger somewhere on the watch. Other smartwatch systems can monitor the heart rate by using pulse oximetry,  which shines LEDs and IR LEDs on to the user's wrist to determine the heart rate. While these solutions are extremely mobile, comfortable for long time use, and feature many additional features, such devices are commonly very expensive. While the price may be considered low to some, many who struggle to afford groceries, medication, and/or will not be able to afford such a device. Even if such a device was suggested by their medical care physician, insurance companies are not guaranteed to reimburse the full cost of the device. 

On the other hand, medical heart rate monitors, such as a 6 lead EKG or fingertip pulse oximeter,  are much less expensive, they are often extremely bulky and not mobile.  Additionally, many people may struggle with learning how to use such a device, such as older folks, who are a major subgroup who will benefit from such a device. Furthermore, many times, these devices are single use, which can cause ethical, environmental concerns for many. 

# Proposed Solutions

As our arterial blood vessels pump oxygenated blood around the body in synchrony with out cardiac heart beats, the volumetric changes in blood flow can be seen in the chnage in absorbed light by blood vessels. We plan to harness this change in absorbed light using photoplethysmography (PPG). A PPG uses a light source and a photodectors to detect the change in light absorption to track volumetric changes in blood flow. The AC component of this biosignal reflects the pulse activity while the DC component reflects blood protein concentrations, blood oxygenation level, and other biometric information.

In our project, we plan to create a mobile, low cost, heart rate monitor that allows users to wear the monitor around their wrist for longs periods of time whie displaying their heart rate. In order to accomplish this, we can to use a reflective-mode PPG which allows us to collect the heart rate from a single plane of skin. As a PPG is small and low-cost, this will allow us to create a very low cost heart rate monitor compared to already existing solutions.
